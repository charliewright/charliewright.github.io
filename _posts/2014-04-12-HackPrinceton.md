I went to [HackPrinceton](http://hackprinceton.com) hackathon the weekend of March 28-30 at Princeton University. A hackahon is a all-night Computer Coding contest where you try and make something to impress judges, pad your resume and get street cred. I hit up Yale Hacks in Connecticutt in the fall and had limited success, but I learned a lot. I was inspired by the hacker culture, and was impressed by the people. These folks have a lot of passion, skills and are willing to share it with you. 

<br>

Since then, I have had a desire to improve. In the past months, I have upgraded my programming skills, and have immersed myself in the hacker world. I read hacker news, talk startups with my friends, listen to the Silicon Real podcast, and get my hands dirty with code at any opportunity. 


###Back to the Hackathon

 The HackMcGill student society organized a full greyhound bus of hacking enthusiasts. We left Thursday morning and returned to Montreal (cold and snowy as ever) in the early hours of Monday morning. As a hackathon veteran (I have been to a hackathon before, many people are first timers), I caught up on some sleep and brainstormed ideas with my friends during the ~6 hour journey to Princeton. My team consisted of  [Geoff Long](https://github.com/GeoffreyLong), [Rishabh Tandon](https://github.com/rishabt) and Deepak Sharma.

When we arrived, I took as much swag as I felt was socially appropriate: free t-shirts, stickers, google pens, sunglasses, cases of sugar free redBull. We loaded up on chinese food supper and got to coding. I'd like to give a huge shoutout to the HackPrinceton organizers and sponsors. We were well fed, there was tons of space to code, and I enjoyed the basketball/eating/jeopardy/tennis competitions that broke up the tedium of coding. I'm sure I would have enjoyed your campus had it not rained the whole weekend.

###The idea
We decided that we would make a speed reader mobile app: a cross between Spritz and Readability/Instapaper. It was a 40 hour competition, a marathon in Hackathon terms. We buckled down, and got to coding.

###Technologies used

We were planning on using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) to make the app. PhoneGap allows you to make a mobile app using javascript, HTML and CSS. You can deploy it to Windows Phone, iOS and Android. 

<br>

When we arrived, there was a booth set up with guys from [intel](www.intel.com). They were promoting [intel xdk](http://xdk-software.intel.com/), a platform exactly like phonegap. Except its backed by intel, has plenty of docs, and an IDE to go with it. Oh ya, and they would be giving out prizes to the team that used it the best. It was on.

<br>

We rushed to make the [github repo](https://github.com/rishabt/hackPrinceton) and got cracking. Other technologies we used were: mongoDB, python, digitalOcean hosting, and jQuery Mobile. No bootstrap (for once).

##End result
40 hours, ~8 redbulls, ~5 cumulative hours of sleep, and lots of hustle later, we had an iPhone app.

<br>

Quickreads allows you to download articles from the web and display them to you a la [spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/), or classically without adds. 

###Conclusion

We ended up winning the intel prize. They gave us all tablets! I'm proud of the work we did, and we were all happy it paid off. Thanks for taking the time to read my first blog post!

#####PS: I won the Banana eating competition at the hackathon. As a 195 pound athlete, those nerds didn't know what hit em.
