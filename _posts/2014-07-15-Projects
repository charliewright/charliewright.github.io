I have written this post in order to showcase some of the projects I have worked on to prospective employers

****

###Battleships
I took a year long software development project class at McGill called comp361. During the first semester we learned about software modelling techniques and in the second semester we were to build a multiplayer, real time strategy implementation of the popular game Battleships. Although the class would support us doing the project in Java, we were able to use any language we wanted to for the implementation. My team consisted of Leo, John and Amedee. We decided to use Meteor, a javascript platform, to make a browser-based game. We figured it would give us a good opportunity to learn about full stack web development: Javascript, Html and MongoDB.

####What I learned

| • We decided to make the battleship grid using HTML elements. It allowed me to learn about CSS selectors, and web design using twitter bootstrap. 
| • We used github as our code repository, so I learned how to use git to branch, merge etc
| • Using a well thought-out object oriented design to represent different sorts of ships with attributes
| • Designing a client-server architecture to handle multiple users playing multiple games simultaneously. Everything was stored in JSON format in the MongoDB. Meteor JS was great for this!
| • Building a website from the ground up, with user logins, a chat feature, and a good looking design. 
| • Working with a team, staying motivated and positive! Dividing up work equitably, being accountable and getting things done!

You can see our github repo here, it is fun to look at the metrics to see "crunch time" before milestone presentations. 


####Building a Facebook dashboard
In the summer of 2013 I worked at an Ottawa-Based company called RocketOwl. They had a facebook game called Greenspace that was beginning to get traction. Facebook has an analytics dashboard that can tell you things like the number of daily active users, revenue, and some demographic data. My job was to analyze data on the game itself: to see what users were doing in the game with the goal being to increase user retention. I worked in C# and the Microsoft .NET framework. First, I built a web service that pushed pertinent game data into a SQL database. I made queries that updated metrics on this data, and then built a web-based dashboard to display data. Examples are: showing at what point in the game users made purchases, where users quit or get stuck and what power users do differently etc. 

I enjoyed learning C# as there is plenty of documentation. I got to read books on OO design patterns, web design and the .NET framework.

I particularly enjoyed the freedom to explore the dataset and to finding what trends in the data are relevant to the company. I believe I got to use my economics training to understand the decision-making of users. 

####Building a mobile app over the weekend
I wrote another blog post about this after I went to the hackathon [here](http://charliewright.github.io/articles/2014/04/12/HackPrinceton.html). To summarize, I went to Princeton's Hackathon in the spring. Over 40 hours, I made a mobile app using intel XDK which is similar to phoneGap. You make a UI using html/css and then backend using javascript. I was already a little familiar with that web stack which made the learning curve less steep. We made an app that downloads web content (articles, books, blogs) and presents them without adds. Our "wow" feature allows you to speed read it, shamelessly ripped off from a tool called [spritz](). I learned how to work well during crunch time, and that it is possible to learn a new technology in a short time.
