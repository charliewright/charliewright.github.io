Living as a consumer in the 21'st century, sometimes I purchase things. Mostly I buy food but I also pay rent, drink beer, go skiing, drive a car, pay for a gym membership, and own some tools, clothing and bikes. I try to optimize my purchases, because I believe that to acumulate money it is easier to cut spending than increase income.

I work at a software company in exchange for money. My current job is lots of fun when compared to other jobs I have had like working in kitchens, landscaping, and other sorts of manual labor. Still, I think it would be more fun to spend my days working on my own projects with lots of time for leisure (book reading, excercise, outdoors activities). 

For the purpose of this article, I will frame my job as an exchange of time for money. Every day I make a conscious decision to exchange my time for money and in turn, I exchange this money for goods and services. With each purchase I am trading my time for goods and services. I try to think about every purchase through this framework. 

If you want to buy a $10 t-shirt, you should think: 

* Is this t-shirt worth $10?
* Is this t-shit worth 1 hour of my wage?
* Will I get more than 10$ of value from this shirt, is it a net value-add to my life?

But it is more complicated than that! Choosing to go without the $10 t-shirt will net you much more than $10. 

In order to earn the $10, you probably had to pay about 30% worth of income tax. 

>Value of $10 with 30% income tax = $14.2

If your wage is $10 an hour, your hourly wage does not take into account your commuting time, which for many people is significant! Lets assume you are 90% efficient, that is, 10% of your 24 hours is spent getting to and from work, or thinking about work. 

>Value of $10 with tax and efficiency = $15.7

But wait! For each $10 you save, your yearly expenses go down by $10. The amount of money you need to live goes down by $10. I put that $10 directly into my savings, which will conservatively, after inflation, earn 4% compound growth until the day I retire (hopefully around 15 years from now). Through the magic of compound interest, $10 turns into $18 by the time I retire.

>Value of $10 with tax, efficiency, and 15 years of growth = $28.3

In my situation, every dollar I save today is worth $2.83. Thinking about this allows me to defer purchases of things that I don't really need.
