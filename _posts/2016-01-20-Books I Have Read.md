I read a few books for pleasure last year. I Think that book reading is important for my personal development and goals. Here is a list of books from which I will read in 2016! I have compiled this list from blog posts, friends recommendations etc. 

* Common Ground - Justin Trudeau
I read Trudeau's memoir in Whistler BC at the library. I was shocked to see how similarly my trajectory followed his: French Immersion elementary school in Ottawa, Private High school, McGill University Bachelors of arts, big road trip post graduation and then moving to BC to ski Whistler on the weekends! I was inspired by the lessons of respect, humility and kindness that Justin learned from his family and priviledged upbringing. I can learn something from this guy!

* A Random Walk Down Wall Street - 	Burton Malkiel
I need to do some analysis on how much my broker is charging me for the priviledge of investing with them. Index funds seem like the way to go! This book came highly recommended by MrMoneyMustache. I will be preaching the virtues of index investing to all of my friends, but I better put my money where my mouth is! 

* The House that Bogle Built
After hearing about John Bogle and Vanguard index funds in Malkiel's book I decided I should learn more before investing. It was a worthwile read for the historical significance, but it didn't seem that Bogle lead an exceptionally inspiring life. I do, however, think that his business of providing low cost index funds has allowed many people to live inspired lives.

* Where men win glory - Jon Krakauer

* Into Thin Air - John Krakauer

* Into the wild - John Krakauer

* American Psycho - Brett Easton Ellis

* In Defense of food - Michael Pollan

* The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal - Ben Mezrich

* The martian -> super good

* The Undoing Project - Michael Lewis. I enjoyed this book about behavioural economics. Much of the story was focused on the main characters, but I was more interested in the subject matter. Behavioural economics criticizes microeconomic assumptions that are the foundation of Macro Principles. It turns out that everyone is irrational, so we can't put much trust in grandiose economic arguments.

* The Big Short - Michael Lewis. This is my second time reading this book. Its phenomenal, and very relevant to the current Canadian Housing Crisis. It would be nice to have the conviction to put my money where my mouth is, especially if there is a precise bet to be made. In The Big Short, the Money managers bet against bad mortgages by buying Credit Default Swaps (insurance on mortgage backed securities). In the end, they could have just shorted the big banks, since they ended up defaulting!

* Happy City -  Charles Montgomery

* Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble - Dan Lyons

* Nelson Mandela
