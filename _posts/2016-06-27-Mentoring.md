At work I have been tasked with mentoring our new intern. I think that in order to be a good software engineer all you need are two traits: enthusiasm and willingness to learn. Everything else can be taught. Of course to be productive at the start, you need the requisite background in programming, math and logic. 

As far as things that can be taught, I am trying to teach the intern a combination of soft and hard skills. Examples of soft skills: 
* Not giving up when trying to solve a hard problem
* Knowing when to ask for help, and when to struggle on your own to learn
* Negotiating with stakeholders to figure out how to provide value, so that you don't end up doing throw-away work

And hard skills: 
* Solving a problem the right way. When you are working at a start up you can get away with things that are not scalable since you are the only one that touches it. At a bigger company you have to be considerate: 100's of people will have to deal with your code. If you do it wrong, it will affect everyone
* Trying to write readable code. Writing is counter-intuitive to some beginner programmers since clean code is often dumb code. You don't want to write smart code, because people (myself included) are dumb. The code shouldn't be smarter than the person who has to read it.

Helping out our inquisitive co-op has been a great learning experience for me since I am challenged on my knowledge of our application and tech stack. It is true that teaching somebody is the best way to learn.
