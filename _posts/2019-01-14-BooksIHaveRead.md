In 2018 I was in full-on activity mode. I did lots of skiing in Whistler during the epic winter, and then once summer rolled around I took my mountain biking to the next level and re-joined the crossfit gym while bike commuting several hours a day. This didn't leave me much time for reading. Fortunately, I went travelling around the world between September and Christmas, so I was able to catch up a bit on some reading. 

* The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine
* Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life
* Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt
* Fooled by Randomness
* The Four Steps to the Epiphany
* Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder, and One Man's Fight for Justice
* Right Here, Right Now
* Shoe Dog
* The Underground Railroad
* Weapons of Math Destruction
* When Breath Becomes Air
* The Fifth Risk
