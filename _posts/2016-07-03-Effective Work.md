There are several conflicting metrics when you try to measure your productivity at work:

* The artifact of the work done. In my case, the story card representing the work
* The value to the engineering team
* The value to the product team
* Knowledge gained by the developer (myself) in doing the work.

**The story card:**  Managers and executives do macro-analysis of the summation of story card artifacts. This supposedly tells them something about the productivity of teams. Sometimes, if I want to make my manager (or myself) look good, I optimize my work with these cards in mind.

**Value to engineering:**  Simplifying our codebase to make things easier for engineering. Sometimes I complete units of work that have value purely on the engineering side. This is when we refactor code, get rid of a dependency, automate a process, or introduce a new technology (SCSS compiler, ES6) to improve our workflow. Other engineers or architects like this stuff, but managers don't really care.

**Value to product:**  Complicating our codebase to add a feature that product wants. Sometimes I can add a quick scss rule, or mess around with business logic to add functionality for an end-user. Presto-chango and everyone in product is happy. 

**Personal Business Development:**  Doing work that improves my skills as a developer. This can simultaneously add value to the company in the other three ways (or not). When I started my first job, I did a lot of personal development, working through hard tasks and learning about our technology stack. Working on my skills and moving slowly allowed me to be more productive in the long run.
