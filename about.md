I recently graduated from McGill university in Montreal. This summer, I worked to save up money and then drove across the country. After a 10 day canoe trip in Northern BC, I hope to find full time work as a software developer. In the mean time, I am making friends and brushing up on my coding skills and working on projects.Drop me a line at wrightcharlesh@gmail.com.
