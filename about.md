Hi! My name is Charlie Wright. I have worked as a Software Developer in Vancouver, BC since 2014. My partner and I are moving to Smithers, BC, where I will :ski:  and enjoy the :snowflake:, :mount_fuji:, :evergreen_tree:, :mountain_bicyclist:, :weight_lifting_man:, :book:, and hopefully hack on the :computer: 

<!-- I recently graduated from McGill University in Montreal. This spring, I worked to save up money and then drove across the country. After a 10 day canoe trip in Northern BC, I hope to find full time work as a software developer. In the mean time, I am making friends and brushing up on my coding skills and working on projects. Drop me a line at wrightcharlesh@gmail.com. -->
