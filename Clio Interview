Why do you want to work at clio? 
	-I know some old coworkers that work at clio, they recommend the professionalism, and the care and attention to detail people put into their job. a good team, culture, processes, high quality
	-I read about the role, that you guys are planning a modernizing of the front end stack. That seems like it would be a good way to make an impact.

Why did you leave vision critical:
	-Timing was right: my dad retired, I had just wrapped up a project that I was proud of. I was grateful that VC took me on, but I was also excited to see what else is out there.

Tell me about yourself!

-I worked for the past 2 and a half years doing web/fullstack dev work at Vision Critical. I did a lot of browser stuff, making a complicated single-page web application. I also mentored co-ops and new hires, helped run events with the social committee + c-level execs.

-Before that I studied at McGill university. I did a lot of data structures, algorithms, maths. I did a hackathons.

Behavioural Questions

Project 1: Maps, d3.js
Project 2: Rich text editor!?
Project 3: Porting over UI library from hosted, re-organizing the booting of the app, porting over all of the tests, and the framework.
4: Proud when Ryan gave me a compliment, fixed a bug, wrote some tests, refactored. 

Conflicts : Sometimes I disagreed with product management. I would offer up a better alternative to the idea they were trying to build.

Most Challenging: Highlighter was fun. I had to make a new UI that interfaced with the legacy backend. Design something simple, that was readable, testable, high traffic. Can't have mistakes! 

Hardest bug: Rich text editor. We had a front-end text editor. Think google docs, within our application. It was a shared component, and we wrote a bunch of code on top of the 3rd party application. Dealing with obscure browser tweaks, since each browser has a different html rendering engine. I learned a lot about markup, rules, hacks etc.

Enjoyed Most: d3 mapping. I got to learn a new library (d3), and build something from scratch to solve a business need in a pretty way.


*****BUSINESS VALUE ***** We had a legacy flash application. We built a HTML replacement. I was specifically responsible for several of the modules. I made a "highlighter" module, that had 10's of thousands of daily users.  We were under a hard deadline, already had tons of users so we had to deliver a project without bugs. It took images, allowed people to highlight, and generated a heatmap. 
-browsers played nice, make it interactive to engage users

-I was responsible for the google analytics tracking. I would track events, crunch the data to help make business decisions (should we rebuild this thing, does this feature even get used).

VC that is invested in SASS (shopify), round c of funding. Money in the bank though! In 5-6 years we go public.A good environment, lots of work to take on. Team structures, things change. Frontend devs are changing the structure
