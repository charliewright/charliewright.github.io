I recently left my job to chase the exceptional snow year in the North American West. I am on the hunt for a new job! I am passionate about learning, solving problems and being a complete human being. 

> "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."	

-Robert Heinlein, Time Enough for Love
